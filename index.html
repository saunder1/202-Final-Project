                    Overwatch 2 will have a singleplayer campaign (PvE) mode in addition to the competitive

                The fallout was swift. The gaming community buzzed with discussions. Players, including loyal content creators, threatened to quit. It felt like a betrayal. Blizzard made empty promises, disappointing everyone. Despite Overwatch 2's profitable model, they chose not to invest in the new mode. Corporate greed has once again hindered a great game's potential.
